Ask RipeSeed was originally developed to help potential customers see if our team (at [RipeSeed](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ripeseed)) has the required capabilities to help them with their projects. Any customer can ask about what they are looking for, and the AI assistant will respond back with relevant portfolios <i>(if any)</i> to showcase our capabilities to deliver that project.

## Documentation

### Replacing the RipeSeed Knowledge Base

To customize the chatbot's responses with your own knowledge base, follow these steps to create and upload document chunks:

1. **Prepare Your Documents**: We have provided a [template](https://github.com/RipeSeed/ask-ripeseed/blob/main/public/example-docs/knowledgebase.template) and an [example document](https://github.com/RipeSeed/ask-ripeseed/blob/main/public/example-docs/knowledgebase) to start with and give agencies an idea on how should they create their knowledgebase. Use that or create your own document and place that in PDF format in the "Documents" folder located in the same directory as the chunking script.
2. **Run the Chunking Script**: Use our script located [here](https://github.com/RipeSeed/ask-ripeseed/blob/main/scripts/ask_ripeseed_LC_chunking.ipynb). This script is an `.ipynb` file that can be run locally using Jupyter Notebook or online via Google Colab.
3. **Configure the Script**: In the `upload_documents_service` function, set up the following variables:
   - `api_key`: Your Pinecone API key.
   - `pinecone.Index()`: Your Pinecone index name.
   - `openai_api_key`: Your OpenAI API key.
   - `id`: A hardcoded identifier in the metadata of vectors for distinguishing your documents in the vector database.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute all the cells in sequence. This will vectorize your documents and store them in Pinecone with the specified index and metadata.

## Running the Application

To run Ask RipeSeed locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   - `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING`: Your MongoDB connection string.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`: Google Analytics ID.
   - `OPENAI_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
   - `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key.
   - `PINECONE_INDEX`: Your Pinecone index name.
   - `RIPESEED_DOC_INDEX_ID`: The hardcoded ID for your indexed document in Pinecone.
   - `RIPESEED_OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI key for querying the knowledge base.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDLY`: Your calendly link.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
